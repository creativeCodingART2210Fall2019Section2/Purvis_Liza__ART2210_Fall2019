For my final, I decided to improve the graphics for my previous game. I originally wanted to incorporate animation via PNG frames, but the frames wouldn’t properly import into the JS file. I used vector drawing for each of the jpegs, and also used a pink color overlay to ensure that I could properly light the images. I changed the background of the canvas to ensure that it wouldn’t be too saturated. 
In terms of editing, I also edited the score screen to make it more responsive. In order for the player to see where they want to click, I also made sure that the character appeared behind the mouse. The jitter function was also tweaked a bit to ensure that it could be more noticeable
Since I wanted to add a winner’s screen, I also wanted to add a clearInterval function. That way it would be able to refresh after all the cupcakes are collected.
