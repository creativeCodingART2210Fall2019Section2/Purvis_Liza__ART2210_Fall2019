For my final, my goal was to improve previous assets that I have created with project 2. I also wanted to incorporate my own new assets (original sprites) to make it look more polished. I also wanted to see if I could incorporate completely new elements, such as a win screen and a lose screen, however I only managed to create a win screen. I also wanted to program in obstacles, but with the logic that I was trying to implement, it didn't work out. So, in an effort to improve without keeping it the same, I focused more on the sprite development.

For my final, I decided to improve the graphics for my previous game. I originally wanted to incorporate animation via PNG frames, but the frames wouldn’t properly import into the JS file. I used vector drawing for each of the jpegs, and also used a pink color overlay to ensure that I could properly light the images. I changed the background of the canvas to ensure that it wouldn’t be too saturated and make the sprites vibrate with color too much.

In terms of editing, I made the images bigger (depending on the window size) to ensure good visibility of the clickable icons. I also edited the score screen to make it more responsive. In order for the player to see where they want to click, I also made sure that the character appeared behind the mouse. The jitter function was also tweaked a bit to ensure that the movement could be more noticeable and easier. I made the sprites bigger, however on my monitor they were the perfect size, they appeared humongous on any other screen. 

Since I wanted to add a winner’s screen, I also decided to add a clearInterval function. That way it would be able to refresh after all the cupcakes are collected without the player having to manually do it.
